# Gitpod (and some other stuff) demo

This repo is contains demo and template scripts for using online tools
to create sharable and "ephemeral" coding environments.

Those are intended for quickly preparing the env without installation
from the client side. Gitpod is supposed to be also be useful for
collaborative development. Personally I think they are mostly geared
towards short-term teaching/demos.
