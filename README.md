# Gitpod (and some other stuff) demo

This repo is contains demo and template scripts for using online tools
to create sharable and "ephemeral" coding environments.

Those are intended for quickly preparing the env without installation
from the client side. So they are mostly geared towards short-term
teaching/demos. Thought some might also be good for collaborative
development.
